Analysis and Forescasting of Health-Related Time Series Data using ARIMA, Holt Winters and LSTM
</h3>

## What's somnAR?
The goal of this project is to analyze and forecast health-related time series data using classical time series models such as ARIMA and Holt Winters, as well as deep learning techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The project will involve working with a personal dataset of health-related time series data, including sleep patterns, physical activity levels, and other health metrics.

&nbsp;

## Objectives


* To develop and apply ARIMA and Holt Winters models to analyze and forecast health-related time series data.

* To develop and apply LSTM neural networks to analyze and forecast health-related time series data.

* To compare the performance of classical time series models and deep learning techniques in terms of accuracy and interpretability.

* To explore the datasets and identify patterns and trends in the health-related time series data.
